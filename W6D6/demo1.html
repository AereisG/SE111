    <title>W6 | JS Intro</title>
    <!--One Day I went to the store and bought some milk, the milk was spoiled the way I like it I know because I put my tongue in the milk before I bought it. It took awhile to get the sourness I was looking for and I even had to go into the back after licking all the other milks but, eventually I got it from a large gray bin outside. It was a peculiar spot, why would people go outside to purchase things? Certain products may be best in regulated environments however, an artificial interior enviornment given with enough care should be able to replicate those things quite easily. I suppose easy of mobility would be one thing, however, dollies are quite avaiable and easy to use and the creation of an entire exterior center seems... excessive. This is obviously in reference to garden centers, and does not really correlating to the story at hand. SO regarding my milk adventure, when I brought it back into to purchase the goods they firstly reacted with disgust, assuming they were making pressumptions based on my attire, I showed them I could pay by displaying stick ends as currency. Then a fellow came foward, parting the sea of confused heads with his air of importance and briskness, and told me to leave. The End. -->
