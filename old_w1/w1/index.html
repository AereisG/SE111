<br>
<p>Good evening,</p>
<br>








    <p>Some things about me are: I like food, sleep, videogames, cartoons, and music; super standard stuff but, hey I am who I am. To go more into things, I do not go out to eat but, I do enjoy the flavors, and like to describe what I am eating. My favorite food of all time are burgers there super costumizable and you can make some awesome stuff examples of 3 are a burger I had with garlic aioli, spicy sandwich with hot sauce and peppers, and this basic-ish burger that was too big to close featuring: eggs, lettuce, tomato, cheese, patty, mushrooms, onions, and sauce. Another thing is I enjoy sleeping. I thought this would be common with people but, I actually have a friend who does not like it due to it taking up value day time. That's <b>not</b> how <i>I</i> roll.I would sleep off half of everyday if I could but, I got resposibilities so I usually do not. I play a variety of videogames, I like platformers, rougelites, shooters (<i>even though I am terrible at them</i>) and adventure games to name a few genres. Some specific games are <i>A Hat In Time</i>, <i>Dead Cells</i>, <i>Halo Infinte,</i> and <i>Pokemon</i> just to name a few (<i>If I had to name them all I'd be here all day</i>)
