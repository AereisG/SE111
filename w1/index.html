    <h1>My Name is <span strong>Aereis Gonzalez</span strong></h1>
<br>
<p></p> Welcome to my webpage! Here I will discuss a few things about me, it will be broken down into <b> 3 </b> subjects: <b>things I like, things I enjoy, and random things.</b> Some things I like are videogames, boardgames, and card games. I usually play videogames so, here is a list of a few that I play: <i>Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Super Smash Bros, Ultimate, Halo Infinte  Rocket League and Pokemon. </i> Moving along, some things I enjoy are food and sleeping. If I could sleep all I wanted I would probably sleep 12 hours a day everyday, but I have responsibilities; so unless I am negligent then I usually do not sleep that long. As far as food goes, burgers are my favorite of all time, I like hot wings, and soft pretzels. The <u>last topic</u> for this little website will be random things. So to conclude here are 3 random facts about me! Sometimes I prefer to sleep <u>on the floor</u>, I have <u>too many jackets</u> to the point were I can not use my closet and I think <u>cartoons are awesome.</u>
